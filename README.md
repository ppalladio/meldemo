# Mel Character Demo

This project showcases a demo featuring the animated character **Mel**, including support for UI and API testing with Playwright, and public exposure through a Cloudflare Tunnel.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash

# Install dependencies

npm  install

```

---

## üöÄ Usage

This project supports local development and testing, including Cloudflare-based tunneling and automated tests with Playwright.

---

### üß™ Testing with Playwright

#### API Testing

> ‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAI's transcription API only supports one request at a time. Set the worker number to `1` to avoid concurrency issues.

```bash

# Run API tests in watch mode

npm  run  test:api

```

> üîÅ API tests run across multiple browsers. Note: Firefox had known issues with audio file compatibility.

#### UI Testing

> No API calls are made during UI testing, so worker count can be more lenient.

```bash

# Run UI tests in watch mode

npm  run  test:ui

```

## üåê Configuration

### Using Cloudflare Tunnel

To expose your local server through Cloudflare Tunnel:

1. [Create a Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/clientless-access/connect-private-applications/create-tunnel/)

2. Update your `package.json` script with the tunnel ID:

```json

"dev:webhook": "cloudflared tunnel run [your-tunnel-id]"

```

3. Start the tunnel and development server:

```bash

npm  run  dev:tunnel

```

Your site will now be accessible on both `localhost` and the Cloudflare tunnel URL.
